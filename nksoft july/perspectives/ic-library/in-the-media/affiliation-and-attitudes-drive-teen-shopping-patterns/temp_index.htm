New qualitative research  from Chicago-based management consulting firm NKSoft Group LLC  examines teen affiliation with various subcultures of "tribes" and  reveals insights into the attitudes and behaviors driving shopping  patterns of today's teenagers. The research includes an in-depth  analysis of how today's teens shop including a look at how the skate  culture became a mainstream sport and retail success story</p>
<p><em><strong>MM: Teen tribe trends are focused on teens achieving four  emotional and somewhat conflicting goals &mdash; acceptance, belonging,  confidence and individuality. To reach these teen tribes, how should  marketers approach their branding and marketing campaigns?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Philip Airey:</strong> First, teens usually display a  dominant emotional goal, which is shaped by each individual's  personality, is highly influenced by the social environment and evolves  as the teen matures. Second, the emotional states alone do not define  tribe association. Rather, they are a simplified construct that help  explain sources of preference and drivers of behavior. Hence, marketers  can use these four emotional states to understand the influence models,  which affect their brands, and to enhance brand positioning.</p>
<p>Marketers interested in targeting specific teen tribes &mdash; such as  Skate, Emo or Scene &mdash; should build in-depth knowledge of their teen  affiliates and parents. The goal is to gain enough insight to establish a  credible dialogue with the target group. Ethnographic research  techniques are particularly valuable in this sense. The development of  Nike SB is a classic example. After several failed attempts to penetrate  the skateboarding market, Nike successfully reissued its Dunk shoes, a  1985 basketball shoe that ethnographic research revealed had been  co-opted by skateboarders. Observational and other more invasive market  research techniques allowed Nike to develop an in-depth understanding of  the skateboarding culture and to position itself as an insider.</p>
<p><em><strong>MM: Purchasing preferences of today's teens seem to  center around a handful of brands such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,  Forever 21, Delias, Old Navy, American Eagle and Urban Outfitters. What  advice do you have for marketers trying to expand teen tribes'  preferences beyond these brands?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Airey:</strong> Marketers should focus on learning more about  teenagers, not only from demographic and behavioral perspectives, but  specifically about the drivers of their attitudes. That level of insight  will allow marketers to understand unmet needs and develop brands and  store concepts that appeal to teen consumers. Hollister (owned by  Abercrombie &amp; Fitch) and Zumiez have been able to carve out a strong  position in the teen apparel market by leveraging their insights into  the Californian beach and skateboarding cultures.</p>
<p><em><strong>MM: Teen male and female shopping behaviors differ  significantly. What will drive male teenagers buying habits in the near  future?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Airey:</strong> In many ways, male and female teens behave  alike. Both genders shop in packs, spend a significant amount of their  time browsing malls and are influenced by friends, family and  celebrities. However, empirical evidence shows some general differences.</p>
<p>Male teen shoppers are believed to buy brands, while female teens  tend to buy styles. Store layouts used by apparel retailers often  reflect that distinction. Teen boys rely on stores and their brands to  pre-edit their style choices. For boys, overt displays of clothing  brands are the norm. Teen girls, on the other hand, are more comfortable  mixing and matching different pieces and styles to create a desired  look, which they may have seen in school, on TV or in a magazine.  Shopping behavior is also different in terms of frequency and duration  of the shopping trip. Females also tend to buy more on impulse and are  more susceptible to the appeal of in-store promotional activities. Males  are usually more task-driven, list-based shoppers.</p>
<p>We have no reason to believe that these characteristics will change  significantly in the near future.&nbsp; What may change, however, is the role  that technology plays in the shopping process.</p>
<p>For example, shoppers can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse assortment, verify availability and check prices online prior to hitting the&nbsp; mall;</li>
<li>Use social networking communities to define their preferences;</li>
<li>Use mobile technology for access to promotions during the shopping trip </li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>MM: Today's teens are exposed to various media targeting  their market segment. What role are TV programs such as Gossip Girl, the  OC, The Hills and movies such as High School Musical having on teen  tribes and their purchasing patterns?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Airey:</strong> TV shows create aspirational reference points  that teens use to help shape their behaviors, preferences and  attitudes. The OC, for example, was instrumental in bringing the  Californian beach culture into mainstream America and helped propel  retailers such as Hollister. Other key influencers may include an older  family member, school friend, neighborhood acquaintance, pro athlete,  pop artist, TV personality or movie star.</p>
<p><em><strong>MM: At the start of this school year, much attention has  been paid to male preference for wearing baggy jeans well below their  waist.&nbsp; How does the concept of teen tribes drive this kind of teen  trend?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Airey:</strong> Baggy jeans worn below the waist is more  directly associated with the &ldquo;Ghetto&rdquo; tribe, which is rooted in urban  U.S. African-American culture. It was born in New York's poorest areas,  such as the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. It is highly influenced nowadays  by the rap and hip hop scene. The look usually includes large hoodies,  bandanas, baseball caps (which rise above the head and are twisted to  the side), boots or basketball shoes and golden necklaces.</p>
<p>Ghetto is a predominantly urban, working-class phenomenon. Despite  its origins in African-American communities, the dressing style has  transcended to other ethnic groups, including Latino communities and  impoverished areas.</p>
<p>Made fashionable and re-interpreted by successful hip hop artists,  the Ghetto dressing style inspired a new trend called Ghetto Chic, which  has penetrated other segments of American society.</p>
<p><em><strong>MM: In the recent past, Michael Jordan and other athletes  have served as sources of influence for teen shopping behaviors. Who  are teens influenced by today?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Airey:</strong> It is important for marketers to develop an  in-depth understanding of their target groups in order to learn more  about different influence models. Celebrity endorsements are not always  the best answer. In fact, celebrities relevant for a specific target  group may entirely alienate others.</p>
<p>But in some situations celebrities can be an important element of a  target group's influence model. For example, teens more actively  involved in a particular activity or more avidly pursuing certain  interests tend to draw inspiration from notable, but not mainstream,  individuals in the field. Consider up-and-coming athletes or promising  underground rock bands. Their ability to recognize these virtuosi before  they become known by the mainstream helps authenticate their expertise  in specific activities or interests and lends them enormous credibility  with their peers. These trend-setters, on the other hand, will inspire  others who share affinity for the same activity or area of interest.  These influencers can be another family member, neighbor, school friend  or simply a popular acquaintance.</p>
<p>Action sports apparel for skateboarders, surfers, snowboarders and  BMX riders illustrates this influence model. Avid skaters or surfers  primarily seek inspiration from young professional athletes who may have  once shared a smoke in the local skate park or surfed at a nearby  beach, and are gaining recognition. These emerging icons inspire younger  riders to achieve the same level of skill, fame and fortune in the  future. This helps form a tight-knit community.</p>
<p><em><strong>MM: Your research indicates some key emerging tribes are  those known as Emo, Scene, Skate and Ghetto. How are each of these  tribes defined or characterized and what new tribes do you anticipate  emerging on the horizon?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Airey:</strong> Although some of these depictions may sound  stereotypical, they are helpful to provide a better understanding of key  traits of each tribe. Again, these are generic  representations/examples, not specific characteristics that can be  generalized to all individuals who are associated with these tribes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emo</strong>, short for emotional, is rooted in the hardcore  punk scene from the 1980s and the indie scene from the 1990s. The  dressing style and attitude often reflect a melancholic state. The look  includes black skinny jeans, tight theme or vintage-looking t-shirts,  studded belt, canvas sneakers or skate shoes, long bangs brushed aside  or worn over eyes and black straight hair. They listen to My Chemical  Romance, Fallout Boys, Panic! at the Disco, Linkin Park, and Green Day.  Self-portraits are shot at odd angles. They frequent networking sites  such as MySpace. Brands are kept under the radar and they keep a diary  or journal, where feelings are expressed in prose or in poetic form.</li>
<li><strong>Scene teens</strong> are rooted in the music scene. They  have an artsy style that borrows inspiration from various music genres.  Tribe affiliates are white, affluent and suburban. Their look includes  tight, vintage classic band shirts (e.g. Ramones); graphic and cartoon  character t-shirts (Pokemon, Hello Kitty and Gloomy Bear); tight,  skinny, pencil jeans or straight leg jeans (not flares, vintage or dark  wash); beat-up Vans, Nike, Adidas or Converse shoes. Females wear ballet  flats and other low heeled shoes, huge sunglasses, long voluminous or  choppy hair, over-sized pearl necklaces, septum piercings, and bright  eye makeup. Scene teens closely follow new and upcoming bands, befriend  them and then brag about these relationships. They listen to hardcore,  metal, indie, retro, 80's new wave and classic rock music. Sidekick cell  phones are used for text messaging and sharing photos.</li>
<li><strong>Skate</strong> emerged from the surf culture in the West  Coast, and later spread across the U.S. The rebellious image from the  1990s faded in recent years as skate became more mainstream. Its growth  beyond suburbs attracted a larger influence of urban culture, creating a  new trend called skurban. The look includes loose-fit jeans,  straight-fit shorts, logo t-shirts, caps, hoodies and wristbands.  Skaters hang out around parks, parking lots and other skate-able areas.  They listen to classic rock, punk rock and hip hop. Favorite bands  include CKY, Bones Brigade, The Offspring and NoFx. Skate shoes are made  by DC, Vans, Circa, Nike SB, Nike 6.0, Emerica and Fallen. Clothing  brands include Adio, etnies, Element, Lakai, Hurley and Volcom. They  keep camcorders handy to record tricks and post images online.</li>
<li><strong>Ghetto</strong> is rooted in urban U.S. African-American  culture. It is highly influenced nowadays by rap and hip hop scenes.  Favorite artists are 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Missy Eliot, Lupe Fiasco, Three 6  Mafia, Eve, Usher, Nelly etc. They wear Baby Phat, Sean John, Ecko,  Apple Bottoms, Timberland, Enyce and Rocawear. </li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>MM: What's your best advice for today's brand marketers in reaching today's teen market?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Airey: </strong>Study them. Learn about them from the  inside-out. Understand their attitudes. Do not limit yourself to the  understanding of the who, what, when, where and how.</p>
<p>Be authentic. Create a credible dialogue. Teens can smell posers from  miles away. Do not try to be something you are not. Leverage your  heritage if appropriate.</p>
<p>Know that teens are not all the same. They are the most metamorphic  of all consumer groups. This poses a challenge for incumbents and  opportunities for challengers and new entrants.</p>
<p>Think carefully about how to leverage technology to reach and develop meaningful relationships with these consumers.</p>
