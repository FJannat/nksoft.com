Insurance distribution is  not simply about pushing product. An outsized share of the value across  the entire insurance industry value chain is added in distribution. For  customers, it is in distribution that needs are understood and assessed,  options &mdash; from full risk transfer to self insurance and more exotic  methods of managing risk &mdash; are identified, and counsel on which  carrier(s) and other providers to select is given. For carriers, it is  in distribution that relationships and trust are built with agents,  brokers, and customers, opportunities identified and created, and  products and services sold.</p>
<p>Distribution has also grown in prominence as its share of  underwriting expenses has risen in the past decade. While distribution  expenses may not be up in absolute terms, they are up as a share of the  typical carrier's expense base, having stubbornly resisted the downward  trend evident in other expense categories. Some of this is commissions,  as agents are understandably resistant to having their compensation  reduced. Some of it is information technology, as companies pour  investment dollars into building direct channels, improving agent  efficiency, and becoming the favored carrier of independent agents.  There are other reasons as well, all contributing to a sense that the  time has come to take a hard look at what can be done to better manage  distribution expenses.</p>
<p>Lastly, after decades of stability, even inflexibility, insurance  distribution now seems to be in constant flux. Each year, owing to  retirements, mergers, and acquisitions, there are fewer agencies and  agents than the previous year. According to the Independent Insurance  Agents and Brokers of America (IIABA), the number of independent  agencies declined from 44,000 in 1996 to 37,500 in 2008, a drop of  almost 15% with no end to this trend in sight. The remaining agencies  are larger, more specialized, and wield greater influence with the  carriers who depend on them. In addition, there is the much reported  growth in direct methods of distribution, including but not limited to  Internet distribution, and the attendant costs and complexities of  managing multiple distribution channels.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom has it that it is only a matter of time before  the traditional agent is a thing of the past. Whatever analysis exists  to support this belief masks important details. The perceived trend  toward agent disintermediation is far truer for simpler products like  private passenger auto and term life insurance than for more complex  products and customers (e.g., commercial enterprises) with more complex  needs. And industry-wide trends are more relevant for large players than  small ones, for whom opportunities abound even in shrinking markets.  One thing that is assuredly true is that carriers will be using a  variety of different methods of distribution for the foreseeable future,  and what will matter as much as or more than the specific methods  employed is how well they align with a carrier's own unique strategy and  how good a job it does of execution.</p>
<p>The case studies below illustrate how two companies, facing  superficially similar situations, can and should reach very different  conclusions regarding what constitutes the right distribution strategy.</p>
<h3>Case Introduction: Private Passenger Auto and Homeowners Insurance Company</h3>
<p>Our first case example is an underwriter of private passenger  automobile and homeowners insurance. Its share of the market in the  region where it operated had for many years been stable at roughly 7-8  percent. The company had a great reputation with its customers for  prompt, friendly claim service and rapid settlement. The vast majority  of its policies were distributed through independent agents who  functioned as little more than a conduit for the company's products,  adding little value along the way, with the exception of agents serving  non-English speaking customers who provided to both the company and its  customers an essential service. The company had experimented with  providing a limited set of agent and customer service transactions via  the Internet but had not committed to it wholeheartedly. There was  little product information provided online, and there were no sales  concluded online.</p>
<p>The company became concerned when its market share began to drop  following entry into its region by two prominent national direct  writers. The new entrants were using both lower prices and an online  product and price comparison service to attract customers. The company  saw a need to act before the momentum its competitors were beginning to  develop became unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Case Introduction: Commercial Lines Carrier</h3>
<p>Our second case example is a commercial lines carrier with a long  history in the industry and a reputation for finding a way of  underwriting, and eventually rehabilitating, some of the very toughest  commercial risks, in doing so enabling them to continue doing business.  The company distributed its product exclusively through wholesale agents  who functioned as MGAs. After several years of booming revenue and  profits, customers had begun deserting the company in droves. At first,  executives attributed the plunge in revenue to a vicious soft market  that had taken hold the previous year. After noting that competitors  were faring significantly better, they began to consider other  possibilities. Some wondered whether wholesale agents were being  disintermediated by retail agents with the willingness and ability to  deal directly with carriers, though they lacked the data to know for  sure.</p>
<h3>Principles</h3>
<p>In each of these cases, though there were other contributing factors,  distribution proved central to any solution. In building an  understanding of the problems faced and in formulating solutions, those  companies we were guided by a few simple principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stick as close to what you know as any reasonable solution will  allow. A company with a first rate information technology (IT)  organization, for example, is better positioned to begin selling online  than one for whom IT has been an organizational backwater. This  principle is not meant as a prescription for change avoidance. It is a  statement that leveraging existing strengths is a far easier and more  profitable method of operating than building new ones, where the choice  exists;</li>
<li>Avoid overreacting to industry trends. Overreacting to trends, such  as a move toward agent (retail or wholesale) disintermediation, can be  as dangerous as ignoring them. Only in retrospect are the pace and  significance of trends truly clear;</li>
<li>Challenge each party in the value chain to deliver value  commensurate with its cost. Whether we are talking about lead  generation, underwriting and pricing, closing, renewal, or servicing,  whichever value chain participant &mdash; carrier, broker, MGA,wholesale  agent, etc. &mdash; is capable of producing the greatest value for the cost  involved should bear responsibility for it. This implies, for example,  that if a company currently distributing via independent agents has good  reason to believe it can attract a similar or greater number of  customers online at lower cost in IT resources, it should seriously  consider such a move;</li>
<li>Manage independent agents/agencies as you would your own employees.  Companies that distribute through independent agents should treat them  very much like employees. Seek to appoint the best, monitor performance  rigorously, align agent incentives with those of the company, and  recognize and reward top performers;</li>
<li>Maintain leverage over independent agents and brokers. Maintaining  good relationships is important, but maintaining leverage is even more  important. Leverage can come in many forms - industry-leading products  and services that are in demand with end-customers, attractive  commission structures, technology and support that keeps agents highly  productive, etc. Agents and brokers are a practical lot, and most will  take their business to the carrier that maximizes their near-term  profitability regardless of personal relationships;</li>
<li>Communicate clearly the division of labor among channels. Agents,  often with good reason, are very sensitive to signs that carriers may be  experimenting with new channels, be they banks, call centers, or the  Internet. To the extent that a division of labor exists among channels  and can be demonstrated &mdash; e.g., banks will only be selling life  insurance products while P&amp;C products will be distributed only  through agents &mdash; open and precise communication can alleviate both real  and perceived channel conflict; and</li>
<li>Monitor channel performance and maintain flexibility in case  industry dynamics change. No strategy is forever. In many cases, the  better a strategy seems to work, the more imitators it will attract, and  the quicker the supply/demand equation will shift against its  adherents. Thinking ahead means seeing to it that if one channel begins  to dry up, the company has sufficient time and capability to shift its  emphasis to alternative channel(s). A company long reliant on  independent agents can choose to remain so in the expectation that there  will always be enough customers preferring this channel, but it had  better have a Plan B if this expectation proves incorrect. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Case Outcome: Private Passenger Auto and Homeowners Insurance Company</h3>
<p>Following evaluations of the marketplace, distribution methods, and  internal competencies, the company pursued a major investment in  building online distribution capability. The reasoning was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trend toward online sales of auto and homeowners policies was,  if anything, even more rapid in this region due to its unique  demographics;</li>
<li>The company's independent agents, even after a significant  investment in training and technology to support them, were failing,  with the exception of those serving non-English speaking populations, to  add value perceived not just by the carrier but by its customers;</li>
<li>The average age among independent agents was 55, and few had succession plans;</li>
<li>The company was noteworthy for strong IT capability, and it was a  reasonable bet that Internet distribution capability could be built and  maintained over the long haul for less than the cost of commissions;</li>
<li>The company's reputation would prevent the trickle of desertions  from turning into a stampede, even if agents did start trying to switch  customers to a different carrier; and</li>
<li>The company was financially strong and could weather a period of  high investment during the transition from an independent agent to a  (primarily) direct distribution model.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this strategy has been in place for only a limited period of  time, early signs are promising. The company's website is receiving high  marks from customers. The company lowered its premiums in anticipation  of lower costs, and this has helped stem the tide of defections. While  the national direct writers are still growing market share, it is now at  the expense of other carriers.</p>
<h3>Case Outcome: Commercial Lines Carrier</h3>
<p>In contrast with the distribution strategy for the private passenger  auto and homeowners insurance carrier described above, the carrier chose  to recommit to existing methods of distribution - the wholesale agent  channel. The reasoning was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis demonstrated that the recent drop in revenue had little to  do with the distribution methods employed and everything to do with  deficiencies in product design, pricing, risk selection, and how agents  were being managed;</li>
<li>Competitors were moving toward distribution via retail agents faster  than retail agents were developing the capabilities necessary for (and  large enough books of business to warrant) working directly with  carriers;</li>
<li>The company lacked a viable alternative for the foreseeable future,  given its near total reliance on wholesale agents to perform critical  tasks on its behalf; and</li>
<li>Based on interviews with a number of wholesale agents, demonstrating  loyalty to the wholesale agent channel seemed likely to give the  company a competitive advantage over carriers who had begun working  directly with retail agents.</li>
</ul>
<p>A recommitment to the wholesale agent channel was only one element in  the company's new strategy. Detailed plans were also developed for  addressing the deficiencies in product design, pricing, risk selection,  and agency management as well as for targeting sub-segments of the  market that had until that point been largely ignored. One other key  element of the strategy was to develop a set of services for wholesale  agents that, should the wholesale channel ever dry up entirely, would  leave the company far better positioned to explore distribution  alternatives than at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>The new strategy has since been rolled out to the company's wholesale  agents, who received it with a great deal of enthusiasm. Renewal rates  began rising almost immediately, and the company is projecting a  snap-back in revenue based on plans and projections from its agents.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Developing a distribution strategy is far more complicated than  simply deciding which channels to use. This is, however, a key decision,  and the cases above illustrate that there is no single correct method  of distribution for all carriers in a marketplace. Applying the right  set of principles is key to arriving at the distribution strategy that  best meets a given carrier's needs.</p>
