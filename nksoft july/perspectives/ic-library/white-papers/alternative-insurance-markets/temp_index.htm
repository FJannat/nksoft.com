Best, roughly half of commercial premium has  fled to alternative insurance markets since the 1960s, when regulatory  reform in Bermuda gave a boost to the already growing interest in  non-traditional methods of managing risk.</p>
<p>Among the reasons companies are resorting to alternative markets are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The desire to eliminate an insurer's profit margin and overhead from the risk management cost equation</li>
<li>The need for risk management options during both hard and soft markets</li>
<li>A belief that existing insurance markets are failing to recognize  and/or to reflect in premiums a company's superior risk profile </li>
</ul>
<p>Alternative structures take two main forms &mdash; those that retain and/or  pool risk and those that fully transfer risk to a specialized  third-party.&nbsp; The most common structures used to retain or pool risk  include self-insurance, risk retention groups, and captives. These  vehicles attempt to reduce volatility of large losses or reduce the  overall cost of insurance without transferring risk to a wholly  independent third-party.&nbsp; Although these structures originally targeted  traditional lines of business (e.g., general liability, workers  compensation, property, excess and umbrella), their market has expanded  to include non-traditional lines as well (e.g., sexual misconduct,  pollution liability, animal feed contamination, extended warranty  coverage).</p>
<p>The most common alternative structures used to transfer risk include  cat bonds, reinsurance sidecars, specialized reinsurance contracts and  OTC derivatives. These structures all involve payment of an upfront  "premium" in exchange for full or partial risk transfer, typically above  a threshold amount. These structures often cover lower-frequency/  higher-severity losses associated with a specific event (e.g.,  hurricanes) and are used to provide non-traditional reinsurance.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether one views the resort to alternative markets as  inevitable or as a reaction to the failure of traditional carriers to  evolve more effective methods of managing risk, what is clear is that  carriers must have a strategy for dealing with the growing competition  from alternative markets.</p>
<h3>Evolution of the Captive Marketplace</h3>
<p>"CFOs have come to view captives as a powerful tool in their ongoing  quest for more effective methods of balance sheet management." <br /><em>&mdash;&nbsp; Michael Mead, President of M.R. Mead &amp; Company LLC and Expert Commentator on Captives for IMRI.com 2009</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;A captive is an insurance company that is owned by a non-insurance  parent (or parents) for the sole purpose of providing insurance coverage  to the parent.&nbsp; Initial users of captives tended to be large  corporations or collections of smaller organizations with similar risk  profiles that, brought together, could expect to experience a relatively  predictable pattern of losses. Accordingly, captives may have a single  parent or multiple owners. Rent-a-captives and protected-cell captives  enable smaller companies to rent the captive structure from a sponsor  (e.g., an insurer or broker) without having to supply the upfront  capital. In rent-a-captives, risks are pooled, while in protected-cell  captives, the risks are segregated by company or unit within a company.</p>
<p>In addition to those benefits common to most alternative risk  management vehicles (e.g., reduction or elimination of carrier  underwriting profits as a cost to the insured), captives offer the  potential for an additional set of benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stability and predictability of year over year premiums to manage cash flows</li>
<li>The ability to implement highly customized risk management programs</li>
<li>Greater control over how funds are invested prior to their use to pay claims</li>
<li>The ability to take advantage of the more favorable regulatory environment of domiciles such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands</li>
<li>Direct access to reinsurers and the ability to negotiate concessions </li>
</ul>
<p>The number of licensed captives has grown at an average of 6.75% per  annum for the last 25 years, through both hard and soft markets. In  recognition, a number of states, including Vermont, South Carolina,  Delaware, and Kentucky, have sought to attract captives and made  significant changes to insurance regulations in that pursuit.</p>
<h3>Implications and Opportunities for Carriers</h3>
<p>The risks for commercial lines P&amp;C carriers in the drift of  companies toward alternative means of managing risk in general, and  toward captives in particular, are readily apparent.&nbsp; The opportunities  are less obvious.</p>
<p>In our view, the carriers that will prosper are those that put the  customer's interests first. This means that carriers should be prepared  to identify those customers who would be better served by alternative  means of managing risk and to advise them, involving brokers and other  intermediaries as appropriate, of their options. It is in any case only a  matter of time before a customer will discover for itself that better  means of managing risk exist, and it will feel little loyalty toward a  carrier for whom the relationship has been little more than a  transaction.&nbsp; Having mismanaged the relationship, this carrier will be  poorly positioned to provide the wide array of services that the  customer will continue to need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the products and services that carriers may provide to customers going the captive route are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fronting: </strong>Captives often need an insurance company  licensed in the state where the risk resides to write and issue  policies, make necessary state filings, and pay premium taxes.&nbsp; The  fronting company will then cede the entirety of the risk to the captive  via a reinsurance arrangement known as a fronting agreement.&nbsp; The  fronting company receives compensation for providing these services and,  in addition, for the residual risk it will often assume should the  captive for any reason prove unable to fulfill its obligations.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Excess Coverage: </strong>Most customers will purchase excess coverage for losses that pierce working layers. </li>
<li><strong>Claims Management: </strong>The service that accounts for  the bulk of the headcount in most insurance carriers is as necessary  when a company chooses to form a captive as when it purchases insurance  in the traditional manner.</li>
<li><strong>Loss Control: </strong>Enlightened companies have always  valued loss control services, and the value they perceive is as great or  greater when they are, directly or indirectly, responsible for funding  losses themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Actuarial Pricing and Reserving: </strong>Captives may  engage a third party to assist in determining premium levels consistent  with projected losses and parent company goals, as well as in  determining IBNR and making top-of-the-house adjustments to reserve  levels.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Consulting: </strong>Though  not directly related to captive formation or operation, ERM consulting  represents another opportunity for carriers to provide services to  companies no longer interested in traditional forms of insurance. ERM is  the concept of measuring and managing all risks within and facing an  organization. It involves the identification and quantification of both  traditionally quantitative (e.g., commodity prices, interest rates) and  qualitative risks (e.g., executive fraud, brand erosion). Strategies are  then developed to manage these risks to an acceptable level.&nbsp; Captives  can be utilized in a customized ERM program to actively manage these  risks and facilitate reinsurance above agreed retention levels. </li>
</ul>
<p>Providing captive services is not without risk, as evidenced by  Markel's experience several years ago.&nbsp; In 2005, the Markel SMART  (Specialized Markel Alternative Risk Transfer) product, focused on  captives, risk retention groups, and self-insurance programs, was the  fastest growing product line at Markel.&nbsp; By 2007, however, Markel  discontinued the offering, stating that the "product line simply did not  work.&nbsp; The most common problem was our delegation of underwriting  authority to managing agents without, in hindsight, sufficient  underwriting oversight."</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>P&amp;C commercial lines carriers may not be able to stem the tide of  customers turning to captives and other alternatives to traditional  insurance, but by behaving in an enlightened manner and putting the  customer's interests first, they will retain for themselves a role as a  trusted risk management partner and be well positioned to provide a wide  array of products and services that will continue to be required for  the foreseeable future.<br />&nbsp; <br /><em>&copy;NKSoft Group LLC, 2009<br />We welcome your comments and questions.
