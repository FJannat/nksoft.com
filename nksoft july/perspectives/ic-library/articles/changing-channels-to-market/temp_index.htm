<h2>Channels tend to evolve over many years. Sometimes they evolve so   slowly that companies fail to see the change and don't adapt their   strategies based on where the trends are heading-often finding   themselves in a position where they no longer control their market   position. In the turbulent economic times that we are experiencing now,   these trends are often accelerated as companies make hard choices about   what to continue doing and to stop doing in order to survive.</h2>        </div>

</aside>    <p>We've worked across a range of industries helping our clients get the  most out of their channel relationships. In the process we've developed  some perspectives on how to stay ahead of changing channels.</p>
<p>The trick is to recognize these trends and proactively adjust your  channel strategies before it's too late. It is especially difficult to  see these trends given that channels can be a complicated jumble that  varies widely across different industries and regions of the world-see  sidebar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one our clients in the building products market, over a twenty  year period the dominant channel to market shifted from local market  value-added distributors to a few powerful manufacturer representative  agencies. Going back twenty years, the industry was supplied by a lot of  relatively small manufacturers who utilized value-added distributors  providing design services that complemented the wide range of products  required for large building projects. Rep agencies handled relatively  few product lines. As a result of the distributors' strong customer  relationships and value-added services, they commanded rich margins  typically over twenty percent. But in this industry with building boom  and bust cycles distributors often faced cost pressures and, over time,  they eliminated their design specialists.&nbsp; At the same time,  manufacturer's reps were consolidating and started representing many  more lines from a range of manufacturers-and they added the design staff  that the distributors had relinquished.&nbsp; In many local areas today, we  see one or two rep agencies that dominate the market. These agents hold  the customer relationships, provide value-added services and essentially  dictate terms to the manufacturers and distributors. The role of  distributors has diminished along with their profits as they are now  limited to holding inventory and taking credit risk. The game changed  for manufacturers as the balance of power shifted toward the large  agents that play one manufacturer against another for the lowest price.</p>
<p>In the example above, some of the manufacturers are now in a reactive  mode. Unless they want to live with ever slimmer margins, they must  embark on aggressive plans to restore the balance of power-in this case  likely achieved by better understanding end-customer requirements then  deploying products to broaden their offering (achieved through internal  development but also through acquisition to get there faster) coupled  with channel management strategies to create and capture market value.</p>
<p>We've studied channel dynamics in many industries including: consumer  packaged goods, automotive components, consumer electronics, large  appliances, telecom equipment, computers, and electronic components. We  believe if you are looking for the right indicators, you can anticipate  change in your channels. The four major factors to look for are outlined  below.</p>
<h4>Customer or retailer consolidation:</h4>
<p>The rise of big-box retailers in category after category has driven  major changes in manufacturers channel strategies. Not simply that they  now have to recognize new retailers that want to buy direct instead of  through traditional distributors, but the impact on the remaining  channels to traditional retailers can also be dramatic. For one of our  clients, the cost to serve the remaining independent retailers rose  significantly while market coverage declined through their traditional  channel forcing supplier to look for partners that carried a broader  product range with unfortunately lower service levels that the  manufacturer then had to supplement.</p>
<h4>Supplier consolidation:</h4>
<p>As suppliers consolidate, they too often want to take a step out of  the distribution chain and go direct. Household appliances can be used  here to illustrate a couple of different channel changes as  manufacturers consolidated and took the business direct to retailers. In  several cases major manufacturers acquired high-end appliance brands  with a significant portion of expected synergies coming from sharing  direct to retail sales and distribution capabilities. In many cases the  high-end brands withered as the retail outlets and distribution behind  them could not support the more demanding service requirements of these  premium products-an example of trying to change channels beyond their  limits. While the majors were buying up other players, the remaining  smaller high-end manufacturers saw their channel shrink and distributors  in local markets going out of business. As larger suppliers  consolidate, the smaller premium brands are forced to jockey for  position with the relatively few high-service channel survivors-changing  to the right channel partner becomes critical.</p>
<h4>Support services shifting to new players:</h4>
<p>This can take several forms.The building products example above is a  case where the control and profitability moved from one type of channel  partner to another through the service offering. Often we see situations  where distributors will add services to help their downstream customers  fend off larger consolidators, usually in areas where the distributor's  uses critical mass or scale to deliver the service efficiently.  Independent grocery stores have access to marketing programs, accounting  and IT support, as well as sourcing of private label products just like  the larger grocery chains because their distributors invest in these  capabilities and spread the cost across a broader base of business than  any individual store could. In another client situation, we saw  distributors create a network of repair contractors or get into the  repair business themselves so that local dealers (their customers) would  have that additional capability to fight the big box retailers with  their squads of repair technicians. These types of services can counter  the cost advantages from consolidation and deliver higher levels of  service to end consumers.</p>
<h4>Category expansion:</h4>
<p>As products start out in niche positions and grow to become major  categories, we often see channels emerging and evolving as a result. In  the early days of data networking equipment for the enterprise market,  most of the business was sold directly from the manufacturers to the end  customer, with only about 10% going through channel partners. As the  business has grown, the proportion of business going through various  kinds of channel partners (e.g., system integrators, value-added  resellers, distributors, and local dealers) has inverted-channel volume  now accounts for 90% of the business. In fact, channel partners  providing customized local service have been major contributors to the  explosive growth. In this type of situation, it's important to sequence  your channel strategy properly to align with partners that suit your  target end-customer segments, and be ready to adjust as the products and  target customers change.</p>
<p>Some choose to ignore the complexities described above and simply  view the channel as their customer rather than the true end-user in the  market. Product plans, pricing schemes, terms, and support resources are  largely based on what their channel partners demand-and demand they do  as manufacturers lose touch with the ultimate customer. In the  short-term, it can appear attractive to reduce cost by eliminating  inbound marketing efforts to understand trends in customer requirements  and competitive positions, as well as outbound marketing programs to  maintain brand positions and generate demand through channels. In the  long term though, these types of investments drive growth and  profitability-especially if most of your business goes through channel  partners.</p>
<p>So how do you stay ahead of changing channels so that you are in  control of your strategy rather than being a victim?&nbsp; We would suggest  the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="blue_runin">Explicitly assess how your channels have evolved over the past several years.</span> Gauge how much consolidation has occurred and understand how  end-customer service associated with your products has changed or moved  in the value chain.</li>
<li><span class="blue_runin">Determine if your industry is ripe for some of the changes described above.</span> This is best done by understanding trends in requirements from the  end-customers' perspective and getting their views on how channel  partners do or don't add value.</li>
<li><span class="blue_runin">Realign your channel partners with target customer segments in anticipation of where things are heading</span>. Don't get too comfortable with your current arrangements.</li>
<li><span class="blue_runin">Adjust your service and channel programs to support evolving needs and capture value with appropriate pricing strategies.</span> Don't let your business be commoditized as a result of avoiding or  continuously cutting programs that can differentiate your offering.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we said in the beginning, we expect channels to change at an  accelerated rate in these economic times. Making the required  adjustments will pay-off as long as they are implemented with a clear  sense of where the market is going and what your role is going to be  relative to channel partners.</p>
