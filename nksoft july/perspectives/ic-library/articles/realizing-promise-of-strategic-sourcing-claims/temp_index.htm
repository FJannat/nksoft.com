<p>"Strategic sourcing" is a cost-reduction method that many insurers  have  attempted to implement. While they have had successes in lowering   basic office management costs, these insurers have failed to recognize   the greater potential savings of applying "strategic sourcing" methods   to claims and underwriting functions.</p>        </div>

		           The Innovators <span>More </span></a></p></div><!-- end related link --> </div></aside>    <p>Beginning in the 1990s,  large insurers started to take more systematic approaches to the  procurement of goods and services, especially the basic goods and  services associated with running the business&nbsp;&mdash; office supplies, desktop  computers, temporary labor and printed forms.</p>
<p>Strategic sourcing  grew in popularity throughout the 1990s and became a staple of  post-merger integration efforts, as companies sought to identify and  eliminate overlapping costs in the wake of a merger. As companies  acquired scale, they generated "early wins" for their many integration  efforts by rationalizing overlapping vendors and achieving better  product (or service) pricing.</p>
<p>While the majority of these efforts succeeded, opportunities for further improvement remain for two primary reasons.</p>
<p>First,  in many instances, initial sourcing efforts did not address all the  expenses they could have. Too many focused on basic commodities and  ignored significant outside vendor expenses in the claims and  underwriting functions.</p>
<p>Second, there was a failure to embed key  principles of strategic sourcing into the organization, so that it would  benefit from this discipline not just once but on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>As  such, many companies simply underestimated the savings potential of  many sourcing efforts, and the ongoing savings they did achieve have  fallen short of expectations. Using auto insurance as an example, we  will explore how some companies are starting to address this missed  opportunity and realize the full promise of strategic sourcing.</p>
<h3>Seizing New Opportunities</h3>
<p>Sourcing  programs in insurance companies have tended to focus on basic expense  items such as paper, printing and computer equipment, even though these  expenses represent only a fraction of the overall cost structure.  Sourcing was not applied to expenses within the claims and underwriting  areas for three primary reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some believed that these expenses are too close to the customer and thus too sensitive to address.</li>
<li>Others  believed that the intricacies of the function needed to be understood  for sourcing to truly succeed, and that neither the organization&rsquo;s  procurement professionals nor its outside consultants had the necessary  expertise.</li>
<li>Also, these expenses did not come under the  responsibility of the person sponsoring the sourcing effort (often the  chief financial officer), and thus simply were considered out of scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today,  leading insurance companies are questioning these reasons and are  pushing strategic sourcing into the claims and underwriting areas. In  the process, they&rsquo;re finding that many of these expenses are absolutely  sourceable.</p>
<p>In the claims area, auto insurance companies have  begun applying sourcing techniques to many of the outside vendor  expenses &mdash; costs for outside legal, court reporting services, independent  claims adjusters, medical records services, towing services, dealer  repair programs, glass, salvage reclamation, and medical networks to  name a few.</p>
<p>By applying a disciplined sourcing approach to these  expense areas, companies can conduct fact-based negotiations to attain  favorable pricing and improved service levels. Savings in these areas  can be as significant as in basic expense categories.</p>
<p>For example,  one auto insurance company lowered its costs for collecting, copying  and returning medical records by 35 percent &mdash; without sacrificing  coverage &mdash; by reducing the number of vendors and by standardizing service  levels across all vendors.</p>
<p>In another instance, an auto insurer  applied sourcing techniques to salvage reclamation services. Leveraging  an understanding of the rapidly consolidating market and the associated  implications on vendor economics, a new pricing arrangement was put in  place, along with a set of service levels and incentives to ensure the  timely sale of salvage. With this disciplined approach, the company  raised its salvage proceeds by 7-to-10 percent.</p>
<p>It is a similar  story in underwriting. For example, companies are applying disciplined  sourcing approaches to the various information services used in  underwriting. Understanding a vendor&rsquo;s cost to serve and unbundling  specific service elements for information services such as data pulls,  list management services and credit reporting has enabled some companies  to develop creative pricing contracts, complete with pricing tiers and  volume rebates.</p>
<p>With credit scoring, for example, individual  components such as pre-scores, post-scores and aggregated scores can be  examined and negotiated separately. By negotiating the best price for  each activity, companies can save up to 20 percent in this high-volume  area.</p>
<p>By expanding the traditional reach of strategic sourcing,  companies are starting to address expenses previously untouched by  sourcing, and in the process are generating significant bottom-line  savings &mdash; 10-45 percent &mdash; in many expense categories.</p>
<h3>Moving Beyond Supplier Selection</h3>
<p>Aside  from the opportunities associated with expanding sourcing to other  categories, companies can drive sustainable savings by revisiting the  actual sourcing process itself and taking a more comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>In  the past, many companies have focused heavily on supplier selection  with the emphasis clearly on consolidating vendors and putting in place  better contractual pricing. While this approach is effective at  achieving near-term savings, it does not embed the process in the  organization and often results in savings leakage over time.</p>
<p>In  contrast, companies that have fully embraced sourcing have leveraged a  variety of highly effective tactics, such as effectively managing  demand, negotiating specific service level agreements (SLAs) in  conjunction with price negotiations, and objectively monitoring and  managing supplier performance.</p>
<h3>Opportunities For Smaller Companies</h3>
<p>Many  smaller insurers have dismissed strategic sourcing because they believe  it requires greater scale to be successful. However, smaller companies  can and are dramatically improving their performance by undertaking  targeted sourcing efforts.</p>
<p>The key for smaller companies to make their sourcing efforts successful is twofold.</p>
<p>First,  they must quickly hone in on the areas of opportunity, selecting their  sourcing categories carefully by balancing the size of each opportunity  with ease of implementation.</p>
<p>Second, they must "right size" their  approach for each category, based on its size and potential benefit.  While traditional processes may work for some expense areas, others may  benefit from accelerated approaches such as reverse auctions (where the  "winner" provides services for the lowest price) or focusing the effort  exclusively on incumbent vendors and fast-pathing to negotiations.</p>
<h3>Why Should You Care?</h3>
<p>As  the property-casualty market continues to adjust to excess capacity  with a clear softening in rates evident in 2004, insurers need to again  focus on their cost positions to preserve profitability levels.  Companies of all sizes are discovering that strategic sourcing can  provide a powerful lever for reducing expenses and increasing  underwriting profits.</p>
<p>For large companies, that may mean  revisiting their existing sourcing programs to ensure there has been no  leakage of savings. In addition, these companies will benefit from  taking the same disciplined sourcing approach to key expense categories  within the claims and underwriting areas.</p>
<p>For midsized and smaller  companies (less than $2 billion in premiums), it may mean replacing  current ad hoc purchasing processes and taking a more systematic  sourcing approach, as outlined herein, for the first time.</p>
<h3>Making Sourcing Gains Stick</h3>
<p>How can insurance companies optimize the long-term success of their strategic sourcing programs?</p>
<p>The following best practices have yielded powerful results:</p>
<h4>Demand Management</h4>
<p>Developing  a thorough understanding of the goods and services being purchased is a  prerequisite for effective demand management. Too often, companies are  focused on controlling pricing and are not equally focused on  controlling what is being purchased or on implementing appropriate usage  policies.</p>
<p>The key to managing demand is timely category-specific  information. To this end, it is sometimes best to leverage the vendor to  collect this information and to put in place specific controls. For  example, it may be determined that temporary employees should not have  tenures exceeding 12 months. Having the vendor produce tenure data for  each of their placements on a monthly basis would provide the  information to manage compliance with this policy.</p>
<h4>Service level agreements</h4>
<p>Development  of service levels is frequently an oversight in the sourcing process.  We advocate developing detailed service level expectations in the  request-for-proposal process. These SLAs should be drafted in "contract  form" and carried forward into the contracting process if agreed to by  the vendor, or negotiated accordingly.</p>
<p>For example, to ensure  independent claims adjusters are available when required, it&rsquo;s important  to include in the negotiations process specific timelines for  delivering the r&eacute;sum&eacute;s of adjusters who meet requirements, with  penalties for non-performance.</p>
<h4>Supplier scorecards</h4>
<p>To  fully embed their sourcing processes, companies must put tools in place  to manage their vendors on a going-forward basis. Developing a rigorous  fact base is not only critical for the actual sourcing process itself,  but also should be carried forward in the management of the vendor  relationships.</p>
<p>Scorecards should reflect pricing compliance,  service satisfaction, and should be bi-directional in nature. (Is the  buyer meeting its obligations?)</p>
<p>The scorecard becomes a focal point of vendor management meetings.<br /><br /><em>Sean  O&rsquo;Neill is a partner with NKSoft Group, a Chicago-based  management consulting firm with deep expertise in the insurance  industry.
